# Pure C implmetation of 3D Hybrd GAN containg cross-attention, self-attention and convolution blocks in generator. 

Self-attention, convolution and GAN structure, including UNet in generator has  been implmented in C and python. 



Cross Attention mechanism for 3D tensors in pytorch for DL models  can be used as input to CNN layers and so forth. Here Cross attention or merging two seperate input tensors, and gives same output size allowing to either give multiple input images or introduce new data along the way in the network. This is implemented in python, C and C++.

#Currently building the training script in C as well as the many dependencies which are usually found in pytorch library from scratch. 





TODO:
In C and C++
- Reader
- GAN training and code iteration
- Update read me
- Nested for loop --> arithmetic operations to save memory
